## CLAUDE.md (root)

Global config the agent reads on every call. Free-form markdown. Suggested sections:

- `## Our Company` — what we sell, in one paragraph.
- `## ICP` — company fit criteria (size, industry, tech stack, geography).
- `## Tone` — brand voice, forbidden words.
- `## Sources of Truth` — "deals/ is authoritative, HubSpot is mirror."

## Frontmatter conventions

YAML frontmatter. Keys in snake_case. Unknown keys are preserved.

## Naming Rules

- `<slug>` = lowercase, hyphenated. For companies, the eTLD+1 domain (`acme.co.uk` → `acme-co-uk`). For people, `<first>-<last>`.
- Agents never invent slugs for things they can't verify. If an email lookup fails, write `email: null, email_source: unknown`, don't fabricate.
- The agent is allowed to rename files (e.g., when moving a deal from `open/` to `closed-won/`) via the `rename_file` tool.

## Reserved paths

- `.bm/` — config & caches. Agents must not read or write here except via dedicated daemon APIs.
- `runs/` — agents append to their own run dir, never modify someone else's.
